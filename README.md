# Employee Salary Prediction Web App

  

This project is a complete machine learning solution for predicting whether an employee's salary is greater than $50,000 per year. It includes a full data science workflow from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training and deployment as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

The project is built using a **Random Forest** model trained on the UCI Adult Census Income dataset.

## ✨ Features

  * **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit to get instant predictions.
  * **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning, handling of missing values, and feature engineering.
  * **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a `RandomForestRegressor` from Scikit-learn to predict salary class.
  * **Model Evaluation**: Includes model performance metrics like Accuracy, R2 Score, and a detailed Classification Report.

## 🤖 Model & Dataset

  * **Dataset:** The model was trained on the [**Adult Census Income dataset**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 14 features like age, workclass, education, and occupation.
  * **Model:** A **Random Forest** model was used for this prediction task. During evaluation on the test set, it achieved an **accuracy of approximately 86%**. Cross-validation was performed to ensure the model's stability and generalizability.

## 🚀 Running the Project

This entire project is designed to be run seamlessly within **Google Colab**.  
There is no need to download files or set up a local environment.

## 📋 Instructions

1. Open the [**Employee Salary Predictiont**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IUQGDpWdA11phEWgrxsO83c_Gl_7DPSh?usp=sharing) notebook in Google Collab
2. Run the cells in order from top to bottom.
3. The notebook includes all steps:
   - Data loading
   - Data cleaning
   - Model training
   - Model evaluation
4. The final cells of the notebook contain the necessary code and instructions to **launch the Streamlit GUI directly from the Colab environment**.

## 🙏 Acknowledgement

This project is a culmination of the skills and knowledge I acquired during my internship program. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the **Edunet Foundation** and **IBM SkillBuild** for providing this invaluable opportunity.

Through this internship, I was able to dive deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, learning everything from the foundational concepts to building and deploying practical applications like this one. This project stands as a testament to the comprehensive training and mentorship I received.
